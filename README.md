# Smart Attendance System using Face recognition

This smart attendance system is a technology-based solution that uses facial recognition algorithms to automate attendance tracking in various settings such as schools, universities, offices, and other organizations. The system captures an image of a person's face and matches it against a pre-existing database of images to record attendance automatically.
